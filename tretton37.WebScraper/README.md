# tretton37.WebScraper
This is the code assingment challnege by tretton37 to Web scrap the website and store data locally.

Technology stack
C#
.Net 5
Nuget packages e.e Serilog for logging, HtmlAgilityPack for html/Dom operations

It is an console application which will traverse the each link of a website and downlaod the data and store it to configurable location.

We have tried to make this application generic meaning it will download (web scrapper) data from website configured in appSettings.json.
Added few unit test case using xUnit framework just for demonstartion purpose.


*Personal note
I have learned many stuff reklated to webscrapping from this assignment and I would like to thank Tertton37 team for giving me opportunity and showing interest in my profile.
Looking forward to work with you :)
